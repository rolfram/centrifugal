\section{Centrifugal Force Only}

\subsection{Aspect Ratio = 0.1}

The $E=10^{-5}$ case may be under resolved. May need to increase gridpoint resolution.

Flux ratio values are not making any sense. The ratio is near 1 in some parts of the array, but for others it blows up especially at the outer and inner boundary. Need to ask Nick.

\subsection{Aspect Ratio = 0.5}

Working currently on getting $E = 10^{-4}$ to run on Summit. Attempt failed increased resolution and timestep and also started from $E = 10^{-3}$ case, but the simulation still requires a smaller time-step. May need to run on Pleadis. Leaving plots here as place holders.
