\section{Centrifugal Force Only}

\subsection{Aspect Ratio = 0.1}

The $E=10^{-5}$ case may be under resolved. May need to increase gridpoint resolution.

Flux ratio values are not making any sense. The ratio is near 1 in some parts of the array, but for others it blows up especially at the outer and inner boundary. Need to ask Nick.
